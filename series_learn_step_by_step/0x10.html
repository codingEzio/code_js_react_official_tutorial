    <!-- 
      In HTML, form elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>` and `<select>`
      typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input.

      As for React, mutable states is kept in the `state` property of comp, 
      and only updated with `setState()`. The term "controlled components"
      means for the "render & val-control", they were both managed by React.
